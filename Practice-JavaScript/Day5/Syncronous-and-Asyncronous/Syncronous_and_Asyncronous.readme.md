**Synchronous JavaScript:**

In synchronous programming, code is executed sequentially, line by line, from top to bottom. Each operation must complete before the next one begins. This means that if there's a time-consuming task, such as fetching data from a server or reading a file, the entire program will wait until that task is finished before moving on to the next line of code.

**Asynchronous JavaScript:**

Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows multiple operations to be performed concurrently without waiting for each one to finish before starting the next. This is particularly useful for tasks like fetching data from an external source, handling user input, or performing I/O operations.

JavaScript achieves asynchronicity primarily through callbacks, promises, and async/await syntax.

**Callbacks:** In the early days of JavaScript, callbacks were the primary way to handle asynchronous operations. A callback function is passed as an argument to another function and is executed once the asynchronous operation completes.

**Promises:** Promises provide a cleaner and more structured way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. A promise represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allows you to attach callbacks to handle the result asynchronously.

**Async/Await:** Async/await is a more recent addition to JavaScript, providing a more concise and readable way to write asynchronous code. The async keyword is used to define a function that returns a promise, and the await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until a promise is settled.
