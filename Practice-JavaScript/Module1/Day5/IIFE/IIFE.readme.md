**What is IIFE in js?**

An IIFE or Immediately Invoked Function Expression, is a JavaScript function that is executed immediately after it is defined.

**Why should we use IIFE?**
IIFEs are commonly used to create a new scope, encapsulate variables, and avoid polluting the global namespace.
They are useful for executing code once without leaving behind any variables in the global scope.
They can also be used to create modules and reveal module pattern, where certain variables and functions are kept private within the IIFE scope while exposing a public API.


In summary, an IIFE is a JavaScript function expression that is executed immediately after it is defined. It's a useful technique for creating a new scope, encapsulating variables, and executing code once without leaving behind any variables in the global scope.
