# Explain what a callback function is and provide an example.

A Callback function is a function that passed as an argument into an other function, which is then executed after the completion of that function's operation. callback functions are commonly used to handle asynchronous operations

Let me break it down, A callback is likely saying, "hey, once you done this task just let mme know by calling this function"
in JavaScript callbacks are havily used in asynchronous programming because taks like reading/writing file, fetching data, making network calls dont block execution of rest of the code, by using callback we can keep the code non-blocking and  efficient.

there are two types of callback functions
1. [synchronous callbacks](../Code/Module1/d2/callbacks/syncronous-callbacks.js) 
2. [asynchronous callbacks](../Code/Module1/d2/callbacks/asyncronous-callbacks.js)
