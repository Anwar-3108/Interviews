# (1) What is node.js?

Node.js is a cross-platform, open source, JavaScript runtime enviorment, to put it simply it allows us to execute javascript code outside of the browser, which was not originally possible. it's built on google chrome's v8 engine. which compiles JavaScript into a machine-readable code for performance. it is a powerful js engine written in c++
think of node like bridge between client-side javascript and backend enabling javascript to be used in server-side scripting.

1. Single Threaded and Non Blocking:

   - Node.js operates on a hybrid single threaded event loop architecture that supports asynchronous I/O operations
   - This means it can handle multiple requestes concurrently without waitng one operations to complete

2. Event-Driven Architecture:

   - Node.js is built on event driven architecture, where tasks are registered as events and executed when their turns arrives in the event loop.

3. Asynchronous I/O:

   - Node.js Performs non-blocking I/O operations, making it well suated fot I/O-intensive applications like real time chat apps, REST api, file server etc.

# Why Node.js is useful ?

1. Speed and efficiency:

   - Node.js is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which complies javascript code into machine-code, it is good for hight i/o operations

2. Lighwaight Architecture:

   - Thanks to the single threaded architecture and event loop in the libunv library, it can handel thousands of concurrent requestes without creating a new thread for each request.



# Where I Have Used Node.js

1. In a previous project, I used Node.js with clustering to build a scalable REST API for an e-commerce application. The lightweight nature of Node.js ensured low latency even with millions of requests.

2. I implemented a chat system using Socket.IO. Node.js’s event-driven architecture made handling real-time updates seamless. 

3. I used Node.js streams to efficiently process and upload large files without consuming too much memory.

# (2) How is Node.js a Runtime Environment on the Server Side?

To start, I’d say:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser, primarily on the server-side. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to the browser, running inside browser engines like V8 (used by Chrome). Node.js extends this capability to servers, allowing developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming.


I can brake down my statement like : 

what us runtime, why server-side, how it internally works .... so shall I? 
 
 _note_: if the answer is something like "no"  that's fine else explain further 

 1. A runtime environment provides all the tools, libraries, and infrastructure needs to execute the code for node.js  this encluds

 the V8 engine, which compiles and execute the js code.

 core library like fs, http, etc for server-side functionality

 the libuv library for non-blocking I/O operations

 2. WHy server-side?: 

 Node.js integrates systems-level features(like file access, networking, and process managing) with javascript making it capable of handelig backend logic such as: 

 Processing HTTP requests.
 Accessing databases.
 Serving Files.


 3. How it works internally? : 
 When we executes javascript in node.js:

 the v8 engine compiles the js code into machine code.

 node.js's libuv library handles asyncronous oprations like file reads, network requests or timers.

 the event loop does the oprations without blocking the execution

 

 # What is V8?

 Now, let’s talk about V8.
V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and powers Google Chrome and Node.js. Its primary job is to execute JavaScript code efficiently. it uses JIT compilation (fast) , compilation happens in 2 stages , 1 is base line compilation (qick, less optimized) and 2 is optimized recompilation (more optimized for repeated code). it has a garbage collector which automatically manages memory by identifing and freeiing up unused code.
