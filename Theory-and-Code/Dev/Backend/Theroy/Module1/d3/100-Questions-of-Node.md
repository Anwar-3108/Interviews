# (1) What is node.js?

Node.js is a cross-platform, open source, JavaScript runtime enviorment, to put it simply it allows us to execute javascript code outside of the browser, which was not originally possible. it's built on google chrome's v8 engine. which compiles JavaScript into a machine-readable code for performance. it is a powerful js engine written in c++
think of node like bridge between client-side javascript and backend enabling javascript to be used in server-side scripting.

1. Single Threaded and Non Blocking:

   - Node.js operates on a hybrid single threaded event loop architecture that supports asynchronous I/O operations
   - This means it can handle multiple requestes concurrently without waitng one operations to complete

2. Event-Driven Architecture:

   - Node.js is built on event driven architecture, where tasks are registered as events and executed when their turns arrives in the event loop.

3. Asynchronous I/O:

   - Node.js Performs non-blocking I/O operations, making it well suated fot I/O-intensive applications like real time chat apps, REST api, file server etc.

# Why Node.js is useful ?

1. Speed and efficiency:

   - Node.js is built on Google's V8 JavaScript engine, which complies javascript code into machine-code, it is good for hight i/o operations

2. Lighwaight Architecture:

   - Thanks to the single threaded architecture and event loop in the libunv library, it can handel thousands of concurrent requestes without creating a new thread for each request.



# Where I Have Used Node.js

1. In a previous project, I used Node.js with clustering to build a scalable REST API for an e-commerce application. The lightweight nature of Node.js ensured low latency even with millions of requests.

2. I implemented a chat system using Socket.IO. Node.js’s event-driven architecture made handling real-time updates seamless. 

3. I used Node.js streams to efficiently process and upload large files without consuming too much memory.

# (2) How is Node.js a Runtime Environment on the Server Side?

To start, I’d say:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that enables us to execute JavaScript code outside of the browser, primarily on the server-side. Traditionally, JavaScript was limited to the browser, running inside browser engines like V8 (used by Chrome). Node.js extends this capability to servers, allowing developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming.


I can brake down my statement like : 

what us runtime, why server-side, how it internally works .... so shall I? 
 
 _note_: if the answer is something like "no"  that's fine else explain further 

 1. A runtime environment provides all the tools, libraries, and infrastructure needs to execute the code for node.js  this encluds

 the V8 engine, which compiles and execute the js code.

 core library like fs, http, etc for server-side functionality

 the libuv library for non-blocking I/O operations

 2. WHy server-side?: 

 Node.js integrates systems-level features(like file access, networking, and process managing) with javascript making it capable of handelig backend logic such as: 

 Processing HTTP requests.
 Accessing databases.
 Serving Files.


 3. How it works internally? : 
 When we executes javascript in node.js:

 the v8 engine compiles the js code into machine code.

 node.js's libuv library handles asyncronous oprations like file reads, network requests or timers.

 the event loop does the oprations without blocking the execution

 

 # What is V8?

 Now, let’s talk about V8.
V8 is a high-performance JavaScript engine developed by Google. It is written in C++ and powers Google Chrome and Node.js. Its primary job is to execute JavaScript code efficiently. it uses JIT compilation (fast) , compilation happens in 2 stages , 1 is base line compilation (qick, less optimized) and 2 is optimized recompilation (more optimized for repeated code). it has a garbage collector which automatically manages memory by identifing and freeiing up unused code.

# (3) What is the difference between runtime environment and framework?

1. Runtime Environment

A runtime environment is like the engine of a car. It provides the core functionality needed to run a program but doesn't dictate how you build the car itself. It ensures that the code you've written can execute, interacting with the operating system, memory, or other resources.

_For example:_

Node.js is a runtime environment for JavaScript.
It provides tools like the libuv library (for handling asynchronous operations) and access to the V8 engine (to compile JavaScript into machine code).
It gives you APIs like fs for file system operations, http for creating servers, and more.


_Key Features of Runtime Environments:_

Provide the tools, libraries, and platform to execute code.
Focus is on code execution and interaction with the underlying system.

2. Framework

A framework is like a blueprint or template for building an application. It provides pre-defined structures, reusable components, and best practices to make development easier and more efficient. Unlike a runtime, which just runs your code, a framework actively shapes how you write your code by giving you predefined modules and enforcing certain patterns.

_For example:_

Express.js is a framework built on top of Node.js.
It provides tools for routing, middleware, request handling, and response processing.
While Node.js handles "how to run JavaScript outside a browser," Express guides you on "how to build web servers and APIs efficiently."

_Key Features of Frameworks:_

Provide a structured way to develop applications.
Focus is on application logic and design patterns.
Built on top of a runtime environment (like Express is built on Node.js).

# (4) What are the 7 main features of node.js?

1. Asynchronous and Event Driven:
in node.js, operations like readig a file or querying from the databases don't block the execution of the other tasks. instead these tasks runs in the background and rusults are handled via callback/promises and async/await

2. Single-Threaded Model with Event Loop:
Node.js runs on a single thread and handles multipe concurrent requests using an event-loop, this architecture simplifies the development while beign capable to handel multiple concurrent requests

3. Built on the V8 JavaScript Engine:
Node.js uses google's v8 engine, which compiles javascript to machine-code making it lightweight and fast.

4. Cross-Platform Compatibility:
Node.js works on major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux.

5. NPM (Node Package Manager):
Node.js comes with the world’s largest ecosystem of open-source libraries through its package manager, NPM.
With over a million packages, NPM reduces development time by offering reusable modules for everything from authentication to data validation.

6. Non-Blocking I/O:
Node.js uses non-blocking I/O operations, meaning it doesn’t wait for tasks like file or network requests to complete before moving to the next one.

7. Rich Ecosystem of Modules: 
Node.js provides a variety of built-in modules (like http, fs, os, etc.) for common tasks, reducing the need for external dependencies.
